Create a console application in c# (try to use .net core)
This should keep on running unless closed explicitly. 

It should monitor a folder c:\temp
As soon as a file names Trades.csv is dropped there it reads the file, 
saves the data in a table named Trade and 
moves the file in c:\temp\archive folder with timestamp appended to the file name

Below is sample structure of Trades.csv
TradeID, ISIN, Notional
MX1345,IB1000,800
MX1346,IB2000,600

Use SQLLite for the backend and entity framework to persist the data to the table.

The process should be logged to file using serilog. Try to use dependency injection.

We can have multiple file delivery at regular interval. When a new file comes the old data in the Trade table should be deleted
